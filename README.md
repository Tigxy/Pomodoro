A Pomodoro implementation which should, once finished, display statistics about the learning process.

ToDo's:
 - generating an icon to improve appearance
 - ensure that logging in database is performed as wanted
 - create a new view to display statistics (maybe use OxyPlot? https://stackoverflow.com/a/13630517)
